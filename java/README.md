## Java SDK
At this time, the Java files form the primary SDK. The Java SDK consists of several packages to aid in the development of applications which can interact with the Tygron Engine.

### Core
The Core project contains the central communication mechanisms, utility functions and lists of types and enums. It is required for any other projects to function correctly.

### Examples
Included in the SDK are a few examples which show how to perform simple functions. To use these examples, you will need to enter your credentials and the URL of the server you wish to use in one of the source files: `com.tygron.pub.examples.utilities.ExampleSettings`. The examples will then be able to authenticate themselves.
