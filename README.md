# The Tygron SDK
These are the open-source files for the Tygron SDK, which will allow you to easily create Java applications capable of communicating with the Tygron Engine.

To make use of the SDK, you will need a valid Tygron Account which your application can use to authenticate itself. Your application will have the same access rights as your account allows.

The SDK is currently still in its initial stages of development, but can already be used to communicate with the beta version of the Tygron Engine.

### API Documentation
The SDK is used to facilitate communication with the Tygron Engine API. Documentation on the API can be found on the [support wiki](support.tygron.com/wiki/REST_API) of Tygron.

### Examples
Included in the SDK are a few examples which show how to perform simple functions. To use these examples, you will need to enter your credentials and the URL of the server you wish to use in one of the source files: `com.tygron.pub.examples.settings.ExampleSettings`. The examples will then be able to authenticate themselves.
